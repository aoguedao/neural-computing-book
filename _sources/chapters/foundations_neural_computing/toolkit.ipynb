In a 2009 McKinsey&Company article, Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist and UC Berkeley professor of information sciences, business, and economics, predicted the importance of adapting to technology’s influence and reconfiguration of different industries.\n",

This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.\n",
